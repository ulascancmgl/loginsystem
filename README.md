# loginsystem
-A basic Spring boot object which does create a Jwt Token when user logs in.
-This token can be used to give authorization for other parts of your application/ web site or program,
allowing an easier development for programmers while creating a more secure client side to users.
-You can check out my example login system created in flutter to see the code in action. https://github.com/ulascancmgl/login_system
Remember to look and change application.properties based on your needs for to make the code work.
